    This allocations return a block of memory sufficient to hold a ship structure, aligned along
    a page boundary.
    Linux programmers should use these two functions only for the purposes of portability with
    older systems; posix_memalign() is superior.
    All three of these interfaces are needed only if an alignment greater than that provided by
    malloc( ) is required.
